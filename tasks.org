* TODO Simulate the 3 rounds in a game
1) Initial betting after dealing cards
2) Re-deal
3) Final round of betting

We need to deal with folds in rounds (1) and (3).

** TODO MVP: Simulate without financing
** TODO Financing
Each game has:
+ Small and big blind
+ Betting based on largest bet on board

So we need to maintain a finance profile of every player to figure out
if they have enough to play the current round:
+ if start of round and one of the blinds, can they pay the blind?
+ if betting comes to them, do they have enough to at least match the
  current bet?
+ if they raise, how much can they raise by?

Finally, we need to payout at the end of a round.
* TODO Make a poker bot
Simple metrics for a bot to consider:
+ Strength of initial hand
  + Chances of stronger hand on re-deal
+ Personal finance

Complex optional metrics:
+ Behaviours of other players:
  + Pot sizes
  + Behaviour on each round (do they go for every blind?)
